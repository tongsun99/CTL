# Adaptive Simultaneous Sign Language Translation with Confident Translation Length Estimation
Source code for our LREC-COLING2024 paper "Adaptive Simultaneous Sign Language Translation with Confident Translation Length Estimation".

We also provide [SimulEval-SLT](https://github.com/tongsun99/SimulEval-SLT), a general evaluation framework for simultaneous translation on sign languages.
